# OpenGL in Odin Language.

Learning OpenGL with Odin lang.

## Run

`odin run 1.0_triangle -out:cartoon.exe`

Replace `1.0_triangle` with other examples, ex. `2.0_shaders`.

### For Linux 🫶
- `-out:cartoon` we don't need `.exe`.
- Make sure SDL3 libs are installed on your computer.
- Make sure you have compiled the stb libraries. Run: `make -C "full_path_to_odin_compiler/vendor/stb/src"`.
